OBJECTIVE A position in computer coding has became my main interest. I have discovered this
recent passion when I was at Everett Community College attending my Engineering
classes and computer coding class.
EXPERIENCE Macys, Everett, Washington
Sales Associate, 2013 - 2015
I was a lingerie expert for Macy's. I have received specialized training to properly fit
woman into any lingerie piece that we sold, for example; Bras, panties, shapewear,
ect. . Taking this class was the easy part, the actual challenge for most people was
doing the fitting on a woman. From my personal experience, I have learned to become
very friendly and aware of costumers body reactions. I was very good at my job
because I have always met my sales goal every day. I usually have met my goal for
Macy's card applicants. Eventually, I was able to help with inventory, such as reorder
products and request certain products verses others. The department was basically,
my responsibility.
Target, Everett, Washington
Flow, Cross trainer, 2015 - Present
Working at Target has helped me discover that I am a perfectionist, a fast learner and
a valuable asset to its company. I originally started as a flow team member. A flow
team member takes product off the truck and pushes the product onto shelves and
other displays. Eventually my manager realized on how I am such a great worker, he
started having me work for other managers. Such as, cashiering; my costumer service
skills are quiet spot on. Then the zoning manager saw me one day, fixing up a section
in the store. I couldn't push product because the display was awful, so I fixed it.
Eventually, I started fixing shelving and racks. Now I am working my way to become a
Shoe Ambassador, my training so far is consists of taking inventory of product on the
floor and in back of the store. An imagination of organizing the shoes in the best
possible way to be visually appealing and best way to sell the product. Now I am
eager to learn more.
